Probably the closest to what we're
System is built of modules.  Modules are connected through either method
calls and ports.  Meanings of method calls and ports are by convention
among classes of modules to allow module replacement.  To make this
easier to manage, modules have a "module type" which defines which
interface convention (calls and ports) it implements.  Modules can also
say that they must have some sub-module of a given module type (i.e. a
branch predictor must have a branch predictor algorithm sub-module).

Feeder modules provide the instructions to execute; can be set up to feed
from traces or emulation.

Ports model communication delays.  MoC isn't clearly specified: each
module has a clock method, but how to deal with zero-cycle scheduling isn't
clear.  Ports are stated to be "good" relative to method calls because
they do not have side effects.  Strange mechanism for connecting sub-modules
to sub-modules without the parent modules knowing what's happening.  My
guess is that it is similar to the query mechanism.

Written in C++; writing new modules means writing new C++ classes.

Nice working environment.

Definitely short on modularity/extensibility (even less than

Describes (finally) how to model a pipeline in LISA.

There is an assumed model of how the pipeline works (As Soon As Possible).
Added a thing called L-charts which

Instructions are partitioned into operations.  Admissible operations
(those which can fire) determine how the machine state changes.  The
set of admissible operations is determined in each time step from
precedence rules and resource constraints.  Does not use a rule-based
approach (whatever that is) because it is easier to change the instruction
set.  A Gantt chart is provided for each instruction (thus no dynamic
data routing).  The Gantt chart gives resource vs. time like a reservation
station, but fills in the spot with the operation using the resource at
that time.  Earliest instruction in program order always wins arbitration
for resources.  *Cannot do out of order*

Data hazards are handled by extending the Gantt chart to know whether
reads or writes of storage resources are occurring.  Has operator to kill
things in the pipe.  This is an L-chart.  Claim method for handling
cache misses, but no details given.

Still limited by LISA's ability to have only one pipe.

Big idea: constraints upon microinstruction scheduling (like those found in DSPs).  constraints are datapath, bitfield, and syntactic.

Note that the simulator is an ISA simulator and the constraints aren't going

Say the right things about underlying abstractions and reuse of primitives and
design space exploration.

Uses EXPRESSION (same developers) who claim it can model superscalar
architectures.

Approach was to look at different architectures and decompose them into
little pieces, thus generating a list of primitives.  This is just what
we would call modules and channels!

Control is broken into distributed vs. centralized.  Distributed is simply
static/dynamic instruction info being carried in pipeline latches.
Centralized is a table used for remembering total pipeline state in order
to stall.

Talk about modeling interrupts and exceptions.  Also DMA and external interfaces.

Not a bad idea: there is some attempt to map behavior of instructions to
behavior of hardware.  However, it is completely unmodular: the description
is flat and removing one thing can easily modify others.  The user must also
figure out how to schedule simulator ops (through minor cycles) if anything
other than simple pipe control (extended with stalls, freezes, and reserving
of units) is desired.  No default behavior of any kind is provided; with a
new machine, you start from scratch.

Instruction context is rather like dynids, but in the spirit of flatness,
you cannot extend it in a scattered fashion: it has to be done in one
statement.

Regular operations (artifacts) are rather like channels or buildpipe stages.
Switching one of these out for a custom one is difficult.

ISA must always say how sub-ops map to the uarch.  Because all operations must
be specified, adding stats is done by changing the semantics of particular
stages/instructions, though they can be automagically printed at the end.

Note that instructions must follow a regular pipeline structure.  How an
instruction context is allocated is unclear.  Cancelling is done through
a retire statement (I think), so you have to be careful about statistics to
look at retired instructions retiring in the commit stage.  Exceptions are
probably doable, and multiple pipelines might manage to do MP (but the
absence of modularity and hierarchy would make it hard).

Really, really sketchy description.  Too bad they can't say what they did.

Nice idea of separating models: memory vs. timing vs. behavioral vs. ISA.
Hints at automatically generating docs from description.
Some extensibility (user-defined sections).
Has multiple pipes, and selection would be through if-then-else.  Appears that
you have to program arbitration/resource selection yourself.

Concerned primarily with ISA emulation (handwaves at uarch simulation).
Intriguing references to "well-known simulation techniques."  Uses a threaded
emulator architecture: each opcode has a subroutine.  The
subroutine decodes the operands, executes the instruction, and calls an
epilogue which decodes the opcode of the next instruction to then jump to
the next routine.  Note that it jumps, not calls, so there's some compiler
chicanery to do.  Threading has better I-cache behavior than compiled
code, but slightly better than full decode in a loop.  With pre-decoding (which
is included), it becomes almost as good as compiled code (just has overhead
for operand decoding), I think, with
better I-cache behavior. The neat trick in the thesis is to profile the
simulator and find which sets of instruction encodings are
most common.  Those then become part of the set of routines available which
are selected by decoding.  Thus a mechanism for migrating towards compiled
code (over time) is provided: quite interesting.

Other than that, fairly lame: hard problems in semantics like delayed branches
are hand-waved over to hand-generated simulator code.

Does reference simics.

Lots of references to ancient HDLs, even back to the 60s.  Nice for historical
perspective...  Very much an RTL-level language.

Blocks can be either structural (MACHINE) or functional (ACTION).  Aliased
registers and subregisters allowed.  Derived memory construct allows naming
of portions of state.  Allows hierarchy, though doesn't seem to have a
construct for easily replicating items (could do through preprocessing, I
think).  Actually constructed a MP-target simulator.

They talk about race conditions between statements in the language (identifying
that there is a MoC problem without using the term) but leave it to the user
to fix them.  Some parallel assignments can happen.

Starts by mixing LISA and nML types of constructs, I think, but then it
does a lot more with the concept of signals and strategies.  Strategies are
descriptions of pipeline flow control.  Signals indicate when a particular
strategy applies.  For example, the strategy on a RAW hazard may be to stall
certain stages.  The signal would be asserted when a RAW hazard exists.
Signals can be built from boolean expressions of each other.

Latches between stages are implied, but their datatypes can be defined.
Multiple PC's can be supported by defining pipeline strategies to start
instructions in the pipeline (pretty neat idea that!)

Hierarchy is posible, as are multiple pipelines talking to each other.  Unclear
about what the MoC is for these parallel pipelines.

In general, good ideas about common flow control issues.
Still has an instruction-centric view of what work is to be done in
the processor instead of the processor-centric view common to OOO.  Could
make it difficult to arbitrate between instructions.  Extensibility is
through reprogramming; definitely not modular.

It might be interesting to let buildpipe read RADL to generate simple
pipelines.

Interesting: hand-coded skipping had incredible benefits.  Facile simulator
is seriously slower than SS without memoization, and at most 3x faster with.
It is even worse for one.  This is probably because the Facile code is so
bad.  It is unclear whether the caches and branch predictor take into
account speculative side-effects.

Our time skipping may provide some of the benefits, at least during stalls.  A
monolithic pipeline model might be able to use partial eval to speed itself
up (that might be worth pursuing...)  Might be possible to do globally for
the schedule (we choose the schedule based upon the current channel outputs).
Might also work for complicated channels (say arbiters).
So.... it might be largely an orthogonal technique.  The language itself
isn't such a big deal.

Direct-execution model: not compiled-code simulation, but do binary translation
to host instructions.  Should be similar, but may have problems going between
ISAs.  They handle speculative execution by saving state at branches.  That's
fine, but cannot support direct execution of anything other than control
speculation.  Would be very much like writing the simulator to work with
level 3 emulation.  However, branch instructions call into the simulator
to get branch predictions, so there's a convoluted mixing of control that
might make polypath type things really ugly.

No data moved around simulator, just like ours (when we're not modeling power)

cache simulator doesn't schedule an event return: it tells the core simulator
how long before it should be called again for that instruction and the core
calls it again.  This allows the cache simulator messages to not be parameters
or globals to the core loop.  Also, the core has a tiny amount of state to
keep track of pipeline state (16 bytes + 2 bytes per instruction).  This
allows the core to memoize based upon this small quantity of state.  The
pipeline in the core is limited to ones where an instruction occupies one
stage.  The state also looks at how far the instruction is from moving on.

The cache "retry" mechanism is intriguing; the cache is responsible for seeing
that the return bandwidth is correct and the core just has to go and get it
at the right time.

The core recomputes the dependency information each cycle (re-renaming each
time) so that it doesn't keep dependency information as state.

The PC is added to the state and the whole thing is compressed to give
the "signature" for memoization.  Memoization caches need pruned every
now and then!  A generational garbage collected is suggested.

Look at the compiled simulation paper for the idea of what they are trying
to do.  Then imaginezero, get it zero, details of how they managed to code any of the interesting
stuff (the pipeline) in LISA.

Interesting data point: designing a TMS320C6201 DSP model took 6 weeks for
one designer.  How many days for me?  I'm tempted....  But only 35 seconds
to compile on a Ultra 10....  simulation speed was 307Kinst/sec for ADPCM.
Biggest problem would be RT_x (and getting a compiler :-), though I
could try an interpreter.  Something to do after GLAD is done.

I think what ends up happening is that you write a LISA description which
incorporates all this knowledge: things like a function to call if
instruction in EX is this and instruction in ID is that and instruction in
IF is those.  Then the compiled code calls the magic "one function" that
matches the machine state.   Good heavens!  No wonder it took the designer
forever!  Or maybe you write the functions and then check at run time and
the run time check was nasty.  That would be a basic "bad code partitioning"
problem.  Or maybe the designer wasn't too hot: the paper states he spent
12 months on a custom simulator for a simpler processor....

Philosophical question: is it better to spend 6 weeks making a model which
does 300K instr/sec or 6 hours writing one that does 30K instr/sec?  Think
about this explicitly in the DSP domain...

A bit better description of "compiled simulation" which is the "pre-figure"
what the state of the machine would be at each point in time.  Branching
is handled by providing alternative new states, so running through the
simulator is essentially figuring out what the branch directions are to
know which alternative states apply.  Indirect branches mess things up and
require going to a normal "dynamic scheduling" mode for a while.  Note that
either mode is similar to level 1 or 4 emulation with calls to the simulator
state update functions inside each function.  Dynamic mode would be the
same with a call to "figure out cycle" (our original emulation idea).  This
figure out cycle stuff is table-driven, so it assumes a fair amount of
knowledge of the machine.

Speculative execution might be possible.  I guess you
could deal with "pick the wrong alternative and roll it back" kind of stuff,
knowing which instruction would resolve the previous branch.... but how
would you deal with out-of-order?  I guess you would know the dependencies
at compile time as well, so you would have each instruction check move
the state of the instructions it has affected.  Also, anything variable latency
(such as cache misses) would change the relative timing and the state update
function which must be applied.

SuperSim is the result of all this.  Build process is *very* similar to
Liberty: target object/assembly -> C -> host object.

Neat technique for a (very) limited class of machines.  And none of this
works in a modular fashion or is retargetable.

Timing can be described through use of "transitory storages" -- storage that
loses its value after some point in time.  These transitories can be
synchronized to form stages.  I think that this synchronization/stage logic
defines a basic MoC which allows stages to proceed back-to-front?  Very
unclear.

Hard to tell what is going on within the simulator.  It appears that the
model of computation is ad-hoc; directions of data transfer can be inferred,
but what happens if two units have a zero-cycle loop seems unclear?  State
is definitely double-buffered; all reads happen and then all writes happen.

The long version of the paper.  It gives the full list of sub-functions (the

What's very strange is that it is not clear how it is implemented.  The
system is the V-SAT one (with EXPRESSION), and examples come from that GUI,
but it is unclear whether the primitives are written in EXPRESSION or in
C++ and then made part of the library of primitives to pick from in V-SAT.
I'm inclined to believe the latter, which means that there is limited
modularity.  Users can pick components, but can't say anything about their
control and cannot extend them without writing new components.

An example of using the functional abstraction techniques with EXPRESSION to
change an R10K.  Actually doesn't use the techniques directly; rather,
different primitives are pulled out of the library.  That's nice, but it
doesn't really impress too much, especially since they again use ridiculously
small snippets of code and give no performance information about the
simulator.

Portable upgrade to WWT.  Portability is achieved by abstracting
the components that weren't portable: instrumenting binaries, simulating
the cache misses, synchronizing about time, and communication.  The first
two are affected by the target, and the second two are affected by the host.

Note that it is still direct execution with a very simple timing model
for how long a basic block takes to execute.  Timing with non-blocking
caches may be way off (as they note).

Large-scale system simulator including devices, processors, busses, etc.  Has
"models" which are very large-scale (i.e. whole processors) and can be
swapped for each other.

Uses distributed simulation.  Includes a Python CLI.  Can be interfaced to
VHDL for low-level simulation of a component.  Large API for writing models
(>200 functions and >50 predefined interfaces!).  API can be accessed from C
or Python.  Interobject communication through something like method calls.
Threaded-code emulation with an ISA description language.

Two event queues: one for time and the other for "# of steps".

Probably the closest to what we're
System is built of modules.  Modules are connected through either method
calls and ports.  Meanings of method calls and ports are by convention
among classes of modules to allow module replacement.  To make this
easier to manage, modules have a "module type" which defines which
interface convention (calls and ports) it implements.  Modules can also
say that they must have some sub-module of a given module type (i.e. a
branch predictor must have a branch predictor algorithm sub-module).

Feeder modules provide the instructions to execute; can be set up to feed
from traces or emulation.

Ports model communication delays.  MoC isn't clearly specified: each
module has a clock method, but how to deal with zero-cycle scheduling isn't
clear.  Ports are stated to be "good" relative to method calls because
they do not have side effects.  Strange mechanism for connecting sub-modules
to sub-modules without the parent modules knowing what's happening.  My
guess is that it is similar to the query mechanism.

Written in C++; writing new modules means writing new C++ classes.

Nice working environment.

Definitely short on modularity/extensibility (even less than

Seems close to buildpipe revision 1: allows you to specify stages and bypasses

Horrid Lisp-like syntax.

Describes (finally) how to model a pipeline in LISA.

There is an assumed model of how the pipeline works (As Soon As Possible).
Added a thing called L-charts which

Instructions are partitioned into operations.  Admissible operations
(those which can fire) determine how the machine state changes.  The
set of admissible operations is determined in each time step from
precedence rules and resource constraints.  Does not use a rule-based
approach (whatever that is) because it is easier to change the instruction
set.  A Gantt chart is provided for each instruction (thus no dynamic
data routing).  The Gantt chart gives resource vs. time like a reservation
station, but fills in the spot with the operation using the resource at
that time.  Earliest instruction in program order always wins arbitration
for resources.  *Cannot do out of order*

Data hazards are handled by extending the Gantt chart to know whether
reads or writes of storage resources are occurring.  Has operator to kill
things in the pipe.  This is an L-chart.  Claim method for handling
cache misses, but no details given.

Still limited by LISA's ability to have only one pipe.

Used to generate SUIF back ends, assemblers, and ISA simulators.
Big idea: constraints upon microinstruction scheduling (like those found in DSPs).  constraints are datapath, bitfield, and syntactic.

No notion of pipeline, but could model parts of it as datapath constraints.
Note that the simulator is an ISA simulator and the constraints aren't going
to tell you anything about execution.

Say the right things about underlying abstractions and reuse of primitives and
design space exploration.

Uses EXPRESSION (same developers) who claim it can model superscalar
architectures.

Approach was to look at different architectures and decompose them into
little pieces, thus generating a list of primitives.  This is just what
we would call modules and channels!

Control is broken into distributed vs. centralized.  Distributed is simply
static/dynamic instruction info being carried in pipeline latches.
Centralized is a table used for remembering total pipeline state in order
to stall.

Talk about modeling interrupts and exceptions.  Also DMA and external interfaces.

Not a bad idea: there is some attempt to map behavior of instructions to
behavior of hardware.  However, it is completely unmodular: the description
is flat and removing one thing can easily modify others.  The user must also
figure out how to schedule simulator ops (through minor cycles) if anything
other than simple pipe control (extended with stalls, freezes, and reserving
of units) is desired.  No default behavior of any kind is provided; with a
new machine, you start from scratch.

Instruction context is rather like dynids, but in the spirit of flatness,
you cannot extend it in a scattered fashion: it has to be done in one
statement.

Regular operations (artifacts) are rather like channels or buildpipe stages.
Switching one of these out for a custom one is difficult.

ISA must always say how sub-ops map to the uarch.  Because all operations must
be specified, adding stats is done by changing the semantics of particular
stages/instructions, though they can be automagically printed at the end.

Note that instructions must follow a regular pipeline structure.  How an
instruction context is allocated is unclear.  Cancelling is done through
a retire statement (I think), so you have to be careful about statistics to
look at retired instructions retiring in the commit stage.  Exceptions are
probably doable, and multiple pipelines might manage to do MP (but the
absence of modularity and hierarchy would make it hard).

Concerned primarily with ISA emulation (handwaves at uarch simulation).
Intriguing references to "well-known simulation techniques."  Uses a threaded
emulator architecture: each opcode has a subroutine.  The
subroutine decodes the operands, executes the instruction, and calls an
epilogue which decodes the opcode of the next instruction to then jump to
the next routine.  Note that it jumps, not calls, so there's some compiler
chicanery to do.  Threading has better I-cache behavior than compiled
code, but slightly better than full decode in a loop.  With pre-decoding (which
is included), it becomes almost as good as compiled code (just has overhead
for operand decoding), I think, with
better I-cache behavior. The neat trick in the thesis is to profile the
simulator and find which sets of instruction encodings are
most common.  Those then become part of the set of routines available which
are selected by decoding.  Thus a mechanism for migrating towards compiled
code (over time) is provided: quite interesting.

Other than that, fairly lame: hard problems in semantics like delayed branches
are hand-waved over to hand-generated simulator code.

Does reference simics.

Lots of references to ancient HDLs, even back to the 60s.  Nice for historical
perspective...  Very much an RTL-level language.

Blocks can be either structural (MACHINE) or functional (ACTION).  Aliased
registers and subregisters allowed.  Derived memory construct allows naming
of portions of state.  Allows hierarchy, though doesn't seem to have a
construct for easily replicating items (could do through preprocessing, I
think).  Actually constructed a MP-target simulator.

They talk about race conditions between statements in the language (identifying
that there is a MoC problem without using the term) but leave it to the user
to fix them.  Some parallel assignments can happen.

Starts by mixing LISA and nML types of constructs, I think, but then it
does a lot more with the concept of signals and strategies.  Strategies are
descriptions of pipeline flow control.  Signals indicate when a particular
strategy applies.  For example, the strategy on a RAW hazard may be to stall
certain stages.  The signal would be asserted when a RAW hazard exists.
Signals can be built from boolean expressions of each other.

Latches between stages are implied, but their datatypes can be defined.
Multiple PC's can be supported by defining pipeline strategies to start
instructions in the pipeline (pretty neat idea that!)

Hierarchy is posible, as are multiple pipelines talking to each other.  Unclear
about what the MoC is for these parallel pipelines.

In general, good ideas about common flow control issues.
Still has an instruction-centric view of what work is to be done in
the processor instead of the processor-centric view common to OOO.  Could
make it difficult to arbitrate between instructions.  Extensibility is
through reprogramming; definitely not modular.

It might be interesting to let buildpipe read RADL to generate simple
pipelines.

Interesting: hand-coded skipping had incredible benefits.  Facile simulator
is seriously slower than SS without memoization, and at most 3x faster with.
It is even worse for one.  This is probably because the Facile code is so
bad.  It is unclear whether the caches and branch predictor take into
account speculative side-effects.

Our time skipping may provide some of the benefits, at least during stalls.  A
monolithic pipeline model might be able to use partial eval to speed itself
up (that might be worth pursuing...)  Might be possible to do globally for
the schedule (we choose the schedule based upon the current channel outputs).
Might also work for complicated channels (say arbiters).
So.... it might be largely an orthogonal technique.  The language itself
isn't such a big deal.

Direct-execution model: not compiled-code simulation, but do binary translation
to host instructions.  Should be similar, but may have problems going between
ISAs.  They handle speculative execution by saving state at branches.  That's
fine, but cannot support direct execution of anything other than control
speculation.  Would be very much like writing the simulator to work with
level 3 emulation.  However, branch instructions call into the simulator
to get branch predictions, so there's a convoluted mixing of control that
might make polypath type things really ugly.

No data moved around simulator, just like ours (when we're not modeling power)

cache simulator doesn't schedule an event return: it tells the core simulator
how long before it should be called again for that instruction and the core
calls it again.  This allows the cache simulator messages to not be parameters
or globals to the core loop.  Also, the core has a tiny amount of state to
keep track of pipeline state (16 bytes + 2 bytes per instruction).  This
allows the core to memoize based upon this small quantity of state.  The
pipeline in the core is limited to ones where an instruction occupies one
stage.  The state also looks at how far the instruction is from moving on.

The cache "retry" mechanism is intriguing; the cache is responsible for seeing
that the return bandwidth is correct and the core just has to go and get it
at the right time.

The core recomputes the dependency information each cycle (re-renaming each
time) so that it doesn't keep dependency information as state.

The PC is added to the state and the whole thing is compressed to give
the "signature" for memoization.  Memoization caches need pruned every
now and then!  A generational garbage collected is suggested.

Look at the compiled simulation paper for the idea of what they are trying
to do.  Then imaginezero, get it zero, details of how they managed to code any of the interesting
stuff (the pipeline) in LISA.

Interesting data point: designing a TMS320C6201 DSP model took 6 weeks for
one designer.  How many days for me?  I'm tempted....  But only 35 seconds
to compile on a Ultra 10....  simulation speed was 307Kinst/sec for ADPCM.
Biggest problem would be RT_x (and getting a compiler :-), though I
could try an interpreter.  Something to do after GLAD is done.

I think what ends up happening is that you write a LISA description which
incorporates all this knowledge: things like a function to call if
instruction in EX is this and instruction in ID is that and instruction in
IF is those.  Then the compiled code calls the magic "one function" that
matches the machine state.   Good heavens!  No wonder it took the designer
forever!  Or maybe you write the functions and then check at run time and
the run time check was nasty.  That would be a basic "bad code partitioning"
problem.  Or maybe the designer wasn't too hot: the paper states he spent
12 months on a custom simulator for a simpler processor....

Philosophical question: is it better to spend 6 weeks making a model which
does 300K instr/sec or 6 hours writing one that does 30K instr/sec?  Think
about this explicitly in the DSP domain...

what the state of the machine would be at each point in time.  Branching
is handled by providing alternative new states, so running through the
simulator is essentially figuring out what the branch directions are to
know which alternative states apply.  Indirect branches mess things up and
require going to a normal "dynamic scheduling" mode for a while.  Note that
either mode is similar to level 1 or 4 emulation with calls to the simulator
state update functions inside each function.  Dynamic mode would be the
same with a call to "figure out cycle" (our original emulation idea).  This
figure out cycle stuff is table-driven, so it assumes a fair amount of
knowledge of the machine.

Speculative execution might be possible.  I guess you
could deal with "pick the wrong alternative and roll it back" kind of stuff,
knowing which instruction would resolve the previous branch.... but how
would you deal with out-of-order?  I guess you would know the dependencies
at compile time as well, so you would have each instruction check move
the state of the instructions it has affected.  Also, anything variable latency
(such as cache misses) would change the relative timing and the state update
function which must be applied.

SuperSim is the result of all this.  Build process is *very* similar to
Liberty: target object/assembly -> C -> host object.

Neat technique for a (very) limited class of machines.  And none of this
works in a modular fashion or is retargetable.

Focus on retargetable code generation and instruction set simulation.

Hierarchical description of the instruction set (OR-rules/AND-rules).
Program flow changed by writing to the PC.  State transitions done through
action attributes, which look like snippets of C code.

Timing can be described through use of "transitory storages" -- storage that
loses its value after some point in time.  These transitories can be
synchronized to form stages.  I think that this synchronization/stage logic
defines a basic MoC which allows stages to proceed back-to-front?  Very
unclear.

Full system simulation with multiple levels of detail.  A pretty cool thing
all the way around.

Simulates hardware of an SGI box sufficiently to make booting IRIX possible.
All implementations are complete enough to run everything, but provide
different levels of detail.  Modes:

1) Direct execution can be used on appropriate hosts.
2) Binary translation on the fly for simple processor and cache modeling
3) Detailed simulator

MMU handling is a bit funny, but fast.  Switching between models works
rather nicely because they share a lot of state.

Describes both the GUI and the simulator builder for EXPRESSION.

Hard to tell what is going on within the simulator.  It appears that the
model of computation is ad-hoc; directions of data transfer can be inferred,
but what happens if two units have a zero-cycle loop seems unclear?  State
is definitely double-buffered; all reads happen and then all writes happen.

How fast is the simulator?  They don't say.  All of their examples have
the user running really, really small tests: a few thousand instructions.

The long version of the paper.  It gives the full list of sub-functions (the
lowest granularity of primitives), but not the whole way in which they are
wrapped.

What's very strange is that it is not clear how it is implemented.  The
system is the V-SAT one (with EXPRESSION), and examples come from that GUI,
but it is unclear whether the primitives are written in EXPRESSION or in
C++ and then made part of the library of primitives to pick from in V-SAT.
I'm inclined to believe the latter, which means that there is limited
modularity.  Users can pick components, but can't say anything about their
control and cannot extend them without writing new components.

abstractNote={High on-chip temperature impairs the processorʼs
reliability and reduces its lifetime. Hardware-level dynamic thermal
management (DTM) techniques can effectively constrain the chip
temperature, but degrades the performance. We propose an OS-level
technique that performs thermal-aware job scheduling to reduce DTMs.
The algorithm is based on the observation that hot and cool jobs
executed in a different order can make a difference in resulting
temperature. Real-system implementation in Linux shows that our
scheduler can remove 10.5&percnt; to 73.6&percnt; of the hardware
DTMs in a medium thermal environment. The CPU throughput is improved
by up to 7.6&percnt; (4.1&percnt;, on average) in a severe thermal
environment.}, number={1}, journal={ACM Transactions on Architecture

sequencing and voltage scaling},
url={http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4681641},
abstractNote={On-chip power density and temperature are rising
exponentially with decreasing feature sizes. This alarming trend
calls for temperature management at every level of system design. In
this paper, we propose task sequencing as a powerful and
complimentary mechanism to voltage scaling in improving the thermal
profile of an embedded system executing a set of periodic
heterogenous tasks under timing constraints. We first derive the
peak temperature of a repeating task sequence analytically and
develop a heuristic to construct the task sequence that minimizes
the peak temperature. Experimental evaluation shows that our task
sequencing heuristic achieves peak temperature within 0.5C of the
optimal solution and 7.47C lower, on an average, compared to the
worst sequence for a large range of embedded task sets. We also
propose an iterative algorithm that combines task sequencing with
voltage scaling to further lower the peak temperature while
satisfying the timing constraints. For embedded task sets, our
combined task sequencing and voltage scaling approach achieves, on
an average, 2.1C - 6.94C reduction in peak temperature compared to
voltage scaling alone.}, journal={2008 IEEE/ACM International
