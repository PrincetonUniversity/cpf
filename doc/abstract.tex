The promise of automatic parallelization, freeing programmers from the
error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
parallel processing resources, remains unrealized.  For decades, the
imprecision of memory analysis limited the applicability of
non-speculative automatic parallelization techniques.  The
introduction of speculation overcame these applicability limitations,
but, even in the case of no mispeculation, speculative techniques
exhibited high communication and bookkeeping costs for validation and
commit.  This paper presents Per{\em{spec}}tive, a speculative-DOALL
parallelization framework that maintains the applicability of
speculative techniques while approaching the efficiency of
non-speculative ones.  Unlike current approaches where memory analysis
and speculative assumptions are unaware of each other and are used
independently, Per{\em{spec}}tive includes a novel speculation-aware
memory analysis whose results can be used to infer properties
essential for efficient parallelization.  On 12 general-purpose C/C++
programs, compared to Privateer, a state-of-the-art speculative-DOALL
parallelization system, Per{\em{spec}}tive demonstrates higher overall
program speedup (23.8$\times$ over sequential execution on a 28-core
shared memory machine vs. 11.9$\times$ by Privateer) by reducing
speculative parallelization overheads in ways not seen before.
