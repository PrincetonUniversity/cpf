\begin{abstract}

The promise of automatic parallelization, freeing programmers from the
error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
parallel processing resources, remains unrealized.  For decades,
memory analysis limited the applicability of non-speculative automatic
parallization techniques (NS-APTs).  The introduction of speculative
automatic parallelization transformations (S-APTs) overcame these
applicability limitations using predictions in {\em independent}
speculative transformation passes.  This approach limits memory
analysis's understanding of code with speculation, and leads to an
innefficient selection of S-APTs, techniques that, even in the case of
no mispeculation, have high communication and bookkeeping costs for
validation and commit.  This paper presents XXX, a speculative-DOALL
parallelization framework that exhibits the applicability of S-APTs
while approaching the efficiency of NS-APTs (when applicable).  XXX
works by exploring the impact of predictions in a pass integrating a
new speculative-aware memory analysis with APT cost-benefit estimation
to select an effective APT plan.  On 12 general-purpose C/C++
programs, compared to other speculative-DOALL parallelization systems,
XXX demonstrates higher overall program speedup (23.8$\times$ over
sequential exeuction on a 28-core Xeon YYY vs. ##.#$\times$) by
selecting NS-APTS with lower validation costs in ways not seen before.
