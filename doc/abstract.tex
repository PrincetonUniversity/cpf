% why auto par important?
Automatic parallelization of general-purpose applications frees programmers
from the error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
multicore systems.
% What's the problem?  is polyhedral transformations considered
% scientific??
However, despite decades of research, robust automatic parallelization is
still limited to scientific and data-intensive applications.
% prior work?
Although speculation has been identified as a major enabler for automatic
parallelization and numerous insightful speculation schemes have been
proposed,
%
prior work on speculative parallelization fails to yield scalable speedups
on real hardware beyond a small set of benchmarks, mostly due to high
communication costs for memory flow speculation and extensive
privitization.
% We propose ...
This work introduces LSD, a Low-cost Speculative DOALL parallelization
framework that minimizes usage of memory speculation and privitization
without affecting applicability.
% 
LSD involves state-of-the-art static analysis that minimizes
parallelization preventing loop-carried dependences, a parallelizing
LLVM-based compiler that carefully selects applied transformations by
prioritizing low-cost solutions to parallelization inhibitors, and a
lightweight runtime system for efficient parallel execution and speculation
validation.
% Result, impact?
Across a diverse set of 14 C/C++ benchmarks from various suites, including
SPEC CPU, LSD achieves, on a commodity 28-core machine, a geomean
whole-program speedup of Yx over sequential execution and Zx over a
state-of-the-art Spec-DOALL compiler.
