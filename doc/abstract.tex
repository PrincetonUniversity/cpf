% why auto par important?
Automatic parallelization of general-purpose applications frees programmers from
the error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of multicore
systems.
% What's the problem?  is polyhedral transformations considered scientific??
However, despite decades of research, robust automatic parallelization is still
limited to scientific and data-intensive applications.
% prior work?
Although speculation has been identified as a major enabler for automatic
parallelization and numerous insightful speculation schemes have been proposed,
%
prior work on speculative parallelization fails to yield scalable speedups on
real hardware beyond a small set of benchmarks, due to limited applicability, or
high communication and bookkeeping costs for validation of memory flow
speculation and privatization.
% We propose ...
This work introduces LSD, a Low-cost Speculative DOALL parallelization framework
that minimizes usage of memory speculation and employs a combination of static
analysis and cheap-to-validate speculative assumptions to infer high-level
properties that enable efficient parallelization.
%
LSD involves state-of-the-art static analysis that minimizes parallelization
preventing loop-carried dependences, a parallelizing LLVM-based compiler that
selects minimal-cost solutions to parallelization inhibitors from a wide range
of enabling transformations, and a lightweight runtime system for efficient
parallel execution and low-cost speculation validation.
% Result, impact?
Across a diverse set of 14 C/C++ benchmarks from various suites, including SPEC
CPU, LSD achieves, on a commodity 28-core machine, a geomean whole-program
speedup of Yx over sequential execution and Zx over a state-of-the-art
Spec-DOALL compiler.
