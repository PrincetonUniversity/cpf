The promise of automatic parallelization, freeing programmers from the
error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
parallel processing resources, remains unrealized.  For decades, the
imprecision of memory analysis limited the applicability of
non-speculative automatic parallelization.  The introduction of
speculative automatic parallelization overcame these applicability
limitations, but, even in the case of no misspeculation, these
speculative techniques exhibit high communication and bookkeeping
costs for validation and commit.  This paper presents
Per{\em{spec}}tive, a speculative-DOALL parallelization framework that
maintains the applicability of speculative techniques while
approaching the efficiency of non-speculative ones.  Unlike current
approaches which subsequently apply speculative techniques to
overcome the imprecision of memory analysis, Per{\em{spec}}tive
combines the first speculation-aware memory analyzer, new efficient
speculative privatization methods, and a parallelization planner 
to find the best performing set of
parallelization techniques.  By reducing speculative parallelization
overheads in ways not possible with prior parallelization systems,
Per{\em{spec}}tive obtains higher overall program speedup
(23.0$\times$ for 12 general-purpose C/C++ programs running on a
28-core shared-memory machine) than Privateer (11.5$\times$), the most
applicable prior automatic speculative-DOALL parallelization system.
