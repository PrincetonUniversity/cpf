The promise of automatic parallelization, freeing programmers from the
error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
parallel processing resources, remains unrealized.  For decades, the
imprecision of memory analysis limited the applicability of
non-speculative automatic parallelization techniques.  The
introduction of speculation overcame these applicability limitations,
but, even in the case of no misspeculation, speculative techniques
exhibited high communication and bookkeeping costs for validation and
commit.  This paper presents Per{\em{spec}}tive, a speculative-DOALL
parallelization framework that maintains the applicability of
speculative techniques while approaching the efficiency of
non-speculative ones.  Unlike current approaches which use memory
analysis and speculative assumptions separately, Per{\em{spec}}tive
explores, during a planning phase, the effect of speculative
assumptions and the results of a novel speculation-aware memory
analysis to select the set of transformations with minimal overall
cost estimation.  Per{\em{spec}}tive demonstrates higher overall
program speedup (23.0$\times$ for 12 general-purpose C/C++ programs
running on a 28-core shared-memory machine) than Privateer
(11.5$\times$), the best prior speculative-DOALL parallelization
system, by reducing speculative parallelization overheads in ways not
possible with prior parallelization systems.
