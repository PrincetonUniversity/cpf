The promise of automatic parallelization, freeing programmers from the
error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
parallel processing resources, remains unrealized.  For decades,
memory analysis limited the applicability of automatic parallization
techniques.  The introduction of speculative compiler optimizations
overcame these applicability limitations, but, even in the case of no
mispeculation, these compiler techniques exhibited high communication
and bookkeeping costs which limited performance.  This paper presents
XXX, a speculative-DOALL parallelization framework that exhibits the
applicability of speculative techniques while approaching the
efficiency of non-speculative techniques.  XXX reduces the need for
expensive-to-validate memory flow speculation by cheap-to-validate
speculative assumptions infering of high-level properties that enable
efficient privatization.  On 12 general-purpose C/C++ programs on a
28-core Xeon(or whatever), XXX exhibits a geomean whole-program
speedup of 23.8$\times$ over sequential execution, 2$\times$ over
Privateer, the prior best speculative-DOALL parallelization system.
