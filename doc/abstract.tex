The promise of automatic parallelization, freeing programmers from the
error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
parallel processing resources, remains unrealized.  For decades,
memory analysis limited the applicability of automatic parallization
techniques.  The introduction of speculative compiler optimizations
overcame these applicability limitations, but, even in the case of no
mispeculation, these compiler techniques exhibited limited performance
due to high communication and bookkeeping costs for prediction
validation and commit.  This paper presents XXX, a speculative-DOALL
parallelization framework that exhibits the applicability of
speculative techniques while approaching the efficiency of
non-speculative techniques.  Unlike current approaches which address
specific weaknesses in memory analysis using predictions in subsequent
and independent speculative transformation pass, XXX works by
performing both memory analysis and optimization using a single set of
predictions selected for their overall effectiveness and low
validation costs.  On 12 general-purpose C/C++ programs on a 28-core
Xeon(or whatever), XXX exhibits a geomean whole-program speedup of
23.8$\times$ over sequential execution, 2$\times$ over Privateer, a
state-of-the-art speculative-DOALL parallelization
system.  \end{abstract}
