The promise of automatic parallelization, freeing programmers from the
error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of
parallel processing resources, remains unrealized.  For decades, the
imprecision of memory analysis limited the applicability of
non-speculative automatic parallelization.  The introduction of
speculative automatic parallelization overcame these applicability
limitations, but, even in the case of no misspeculation, these
speculative techniques exhibit high communication and bookkeeping
costs for validation and commit.  This paper presents
Per{\em{spec}}tive, a speculative-DOALL parallelization framework that
maintains the applicability of speculative techniques while
approaching the efficiency of non-speculative ones.  Unlike current
approaches which independently apply speculative techniques to
overcome the imprecision of memory analysis, Per{\em{spec}}tive
combines a speculation-aware memory analyzer, enabling transformations
including efficient speculative privatization, and a parallelization
planner into an exploration phase designed to find the best performing
set of parallelization techniques.  Per{\em{spec}}tive demonstrates
higher overall program speedup (23.0$\times$ for 12 general-purpose
C/C++ programs running on a 28-core shared-memory machine) than
Privateer (11.5$\times$), the most applicable prior automatic
speculative-DOALL parallelization system, by reducing speculative
parallelization overheads in ways not possible with prior
parallelization systems.
