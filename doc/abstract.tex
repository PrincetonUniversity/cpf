% why auto par important?
Automatic parallelization of general-purpose applications frees programmers from
the error-prone and time-consuming process of making efficient use of multicore
systems.
% What's the problem?
However, despite decades of compiler research, automatic parallelization
%results for general purpose programs are far from convincing.
is still limited to scientific and data-intensive applications.
%
% prior work?
Static analysis-based schemes exhibit high profitability but limited
applicability due to the inaccuracy of static analysis.
%
%Although speculation has been identified as a major enabler for automatic
%parallelization,
Speculation overcomes static analysis' limitations and offers high
applicability, but prior software-only speculative systems often suffer from
%prior work on speculative parallelization fails to yield scalable speedups on
%real hardware beyond a small set of benchmarks, due to limited applicability,
%or
high communication and bookkeeping costs for memory flow speculation validation
%and memory live-out handling.
and privatization.
%
%We propose ...
To enable more efficient speculative parallelization, this paper presents LSD, a
unified DOALL parallelization framework that employs fine-grained combination of
static analysis with cheap-to-validate speculative assumptions.
%
This combination reduces the need for expensive-to-validate memory flow
speculation, and allows inference of high-level properties that enable efficient
privatization.
%
%their combined strengths handle dependences that would otherwise require mem
%spec
%
% efficient privatization -> eliminate bookkeeping for live-outs
%
%
%LSD's lightweight, unified (for both speculative and non-speculative) runtime
%system performs low-cost speculation validation and enables efficient parallel
%execution.  unified for both speculative and non-speculative parallel
%execution.
%
% Result, impact?
Across 12 general-purpose C/C++ benchmarks, LSD achieves, on a commodity 28-core
machine, a geomean whole-program speedup of Yx over sequential execution and Zx
over a state-of-the-art spec-DOALL parallelization system.
