Transformations address memory, register or/and control
cross-iteration dependences.

% Just present a list here

\paragraph{Memory:}

%Each applicability guard, based on the information
%on the annotated PDG, determines for each memory object whether the
%transformation can address all its cross-iteration dependences and
%which speculative assumptions need to be validated for the
%transformation to be correct.
%%Object-centric transformation.  All memory objects need to be handled
%%by a transformation.
%%
%%In particular, each applicability determines
%In practice, each applicability guard determines which memory objects
%have certain properties required by the corresponding transformation.
%%
%%each access of the memory object should preserve the property
%
%Each transformation separates the memory objects it is selected to
%handle in a isolated heap (via re-allocation) and ensures that all
%accesses of the memory objects is selected to be responsible for are
%contained within this heap; same in separation
%speculation~\cite{johnson:17:cgo}.
%%
%Each transformation's heap has different sharing
%%memory mapping
%primitives and access permissions. Each transformation has its own
%runtime calls that handle their objects at runtime. Finally, each
%transformation includes in its proposal the set of speculative
%assumptions validation necessary for each memory object for the
%transformation applicability to be correct.
%
%
%%This scheme is similar to separation speculation, but careful allows
%%more effective application.
%
%%Every transformation creates a family with memory objects with the
%%same properties.
%%It collects the set of objects that it can handle.

Memory-related transformations include:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item Privatization: the simple version of this transformation just
ensures the basic privatization property that there are no
cross-iteration data flows for a memory object.

Behavior: Monitor all write accesses of the object and merge write
sets at commit.

Other variants of this transformation express additional properties for
reduced privatization overhead.
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item Independent.

Additional applicability guard: object has no
loop-carried false dependences

Behavior : No write set monitoring performed. Memory object is shared among parallel workers.
%
%
\item Known Last Iteration Update.

Additional applicability guard:
object has loop-invariant condition for last update within the loop.

Behavior: No write set monitoring performed. The live-out state for
object with this property is the memory state of the last iteration
executed before commit.
%
%
\item Predictable Live-out Content.

Additional applicability guard:
The live-out content of an object can be predicted.
%
%
\item Local Private.

Additional applicability guard: object is
allocated outside the loop, but all its accesses are contained within
the loop execution
%
\end{itemize}

\item Reduction

\item Short-lived

\item Read-only

Additional applicability guard: Memory objects that are not written to

Behavior: Separation is enough.

\end{itemize}

%Private:
%Transformation : Separate to different heap, handle live-out state and
%validation cost for any speculation assumption used for the private
%property.

%Short-lived

%Read-only
%Applicability Guard: Memory objects that are not written to
%Transformation: Separate all read-only objects in a separate heap and
%check that their accesses are within this heap.


%\paragraph{Classifier}
%A classifier interprets analysis information, infers properties and classifies memory objects to
%families.
%
%Classifier is the analysis part of memory-related transformations.
%
%show algorithm that classifies similar to Privateer
%
%Each family and each used assumptions (validation) requires some transformations:
%Privatization, reduction, control spec, separation speculation etc


\subsubsection{Register Dependences}

Register dependences transformations:
Reduction,
Replicable

\subsubsection{Control Dependences}

maybe combine control with register deps

control spec info incorporated into pdg. no classical transformation analysis
part here. Could remove this control deps section
