\section{Conclusion}

This paper identifies and mitigates core inefficiencies of prior
automatic speculative-DOALL systems. \name combines a novel
speculation-aware memory analyzer, efficient variants of speculative
privatization and a modular planning phase to generate minimal cost
parallelization plans, avoiding overheads of prior work.
%
\name fully-automatically yields geomean whole-program speedup of
23.0$\times$ over sequential execution for 12 C/C++ benchmarks on a
28-core shared memory machine, whereas Privateer, the most applicable
prior automatic speculative-DOALL system achieves 11.5$\times$ geomean
speedup.

% The modularity of the proposed compiler design allows easy
% extensibility with additional speculative assumptions and enabling
% transformations.
% This framework could also be extended for parallelization paradigms
% beyond DOALL.
