\section{Evaluation}

LSD is evaluated against 10 C and C++ benchmarks in the LLVM Compiler
Infrastructure (revision ...). The benchmarks are selected from previous
automatic DOALL parallelization papers (cite Privateer, SMTLite, ...). We
exclude benchmarks for lack of a FORTRAN front-end , duplicate behavior, or
no significant Spec-DOALL coverage exhibiting.

Machine(CPU, Turbo boost)/OS/compiler(gcc, llvm, optimization level)


\subsection{Parallelization Performance}
Figures Needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item General Speed Plot: With different cores (1-28), all benchmarks
\item Speedup Comparison: 24 cores performance compared with Privateer
Runtime breakdown (how to minimize the overhead?)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Static Analysis and Enablers}
Figures Needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item CAF: with and without; no topping; with only BasicLoopAA and ScevAA
\item Coverage: Spec-DOALL percentage of coverage of each benchmark
\item Enablers: Enablers used for each benchmark
\item Optimization level: Performance with different optimization levels
\end{itemize}

Discussion Needed:
