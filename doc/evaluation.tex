\section{Evaluation}

LSD is evaluated against 12 C and C++ benchmarks, covering all the DOALLable
(showing at least speedup instead of slowdown) benchmarks from two
state-of-the-art automatic DOALL parallelization
papers~\cite{johnson:12:pldi,kim:12:cgo}. We also include one more benchmark
(179.art) from HELIX.

  \label{tab:benchmark-list}
    \vspace{-5pt}
\end{table*}

The machine is using two 14-core Intel(R) Xeon(R)
CPU E5-2697 v3 CPUs running at 2.60GHz (turbo-boost disabled) with 756GB of
memory. The operating system is Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS with GCC 5.5 (version 5.5.0
20171010) and LLVM Compiler
Infrastructure (version 5.0.2).


\subsection{Parallelization Performance}
Figures Needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item General Speed Plot: With different cores (1-28), all benchmarks
\item Speedup Comparison: 24 cores performance compared with Privateer
Runtime breakdown (how to minimize the overhead?)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Effect of parallelization on vectorization}

instrumentation kills vectorization


\subsection{Static Analysis and Enablers}
Figures Needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item CAF: with and without; no topping; with only BasicLoopAA and ScevAA
\item Coverage: Spec-DOALL percentage of coverage of each benchmark
\item Enablers: Enablers used for each benchmark
\item Optimization level: Performance with different optimization levels
\end{itemize}

Discussion Needed:

Present in a table for all the benchmarks which enablers were used
