% HELIX
The HELIX parallelizing compiler extracts TLP by distributing loop iterations between cores within the same chip.
HELIX is a generalization of DOACROSS and DOALL techniques for modern multicore architectures and, therefore, HELIX-parallelized loops include DOALL ones.
HELIX does not rely on speculation to avoid the related overhead, which limits the approach to target only medium and small loops (where the accuracy of code analyses is higher) for most benchmarks.
Targeting such loops increases the communication demand, which makes HELIX particularly appealing when coupled with an architecture support designed to accelerate core-to-core communication.
On the other hand, LSD decreases the speculation overhead enough to make DOALL parallelization practical on existing commodity multicores.
