The planner chooses the best performing set of transforms that enables
DOALL parallelization.

The inputs of the planner are an annotated loop-centric PDG (generated
by the speculation-aware memory analyzer) and the transform proposals
of the enabling transforms.

%
%In DOALL parallelization each iteration needs to run independently.
%Thus, all the cross-iteration dependences need to be handled.

% each memory object and for each cross-iteration register and/or control
The planner greedily selects the cheapest transform proposal for each
memory object and for each cross-iteration register and/or control
dependence.
%for each memory object the cheapest transformation proposal that can
%address the cross-iteration dependences of this object.  %If all the
%memory objects are handled by one single transformations, %then there
%is no need for checking underlying objects.  % %Each memory object
%can only be handled by one transformation.  % For cross-iteration
%register and control dependences, the planner examines individual
%dependences one by one and greedily selects the cheapest option for
%each one.

% While simple, this approach is enough to improve the
% state-of-the-art of parallelizing compilers.
%This is because \name has tightly merged speculation techniques with
%static analyses.
Even though we can always increase the complexity of the planner, we
have not found empirical evidence that justifies such extra
complexity.

% If there is a memory object or a cross-iteration register or control
% dependences that cannot be addressed by any enabling transformation

Note that if no speculative assumptions are used, the planner produces
non-speculative plans, forgoing the need for any speculation overhead.
