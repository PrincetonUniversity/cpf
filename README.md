CPF is a compiler infrastructure that automatically parallelizes sequential C/C++ programs to run efficiently on shared-memory multicore systems.

### Publications
This work is described in the ASPLOS '20 paper by Apostolakis et al. titled "Perspective: A Sensible Approach to Speculative Automatic Parallelization" ([ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3373376.3378458), [PDF](https://liberty.princeton.edu/Publications/asplos20_perspective.pdf)).

This work builds upon Privateer (PLDI '12 by Johnson et al., [ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2254064.2254107)).

### Version Numbering Scheme

The version number is in the form of \[v _Major.Minor.Revision_ \]
- **Major**: Each major version matches a specific LLVM version (e.g., version 9 matches LLVM 9, version 11 matches LLVM 11)
- **Minor**: Starts from 0, each minor version represents either one or more API replacements/removals that might impact the users OR a forced update every six months (the minimum minor update frequency)
- **Revision**: Starts from 0; each revision version may include bug fixes or incremental improvements

#### Update Frequency

- **Major**: Matches the LLVM releases on a best-effort basis
- **Minor**: At least once per six months, at most once per month (1/month ~ 2/year)
- **Revision**: At least once per month, at most twice per week (2/week ~ 1/month)

### Build
CPF relies on [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project), [SCAF](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/SCAF) and [NOELLE](https://github.com/scampanoni/noelle). Follow `bootstrap/README.md` to install all dependences automatically or customize it.

We also provide a Dockerfile using Ubuntu 20.04 for building and testing CPF. Simply run
`docker build . -t cpf:1.0` to build the image and `docker run -it cpf:1.0` to start
a container. By default, the build command will compile LLVM, CPF, and NOELLE, with SCAF
being built as a dependency by NOELLE. Again, refer to `bootstrap/README.md` to change
this as needed.
