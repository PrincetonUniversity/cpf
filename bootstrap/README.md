The bootstrap scripts for the CPF infrastructure.

## LLVM
Compile from scratch and genearte both debug and release version.
The debug version supports `opt -debug` and `opt -debug-only` options but is way slower.

## NOELLE
Compile from scratch and genearte both debug and release version.
Note that both NOELLE versions are compiled with `debug` mode on, but with different LLVM builds.

## CPF
Compile from scratch and genearte both debug and release version.
