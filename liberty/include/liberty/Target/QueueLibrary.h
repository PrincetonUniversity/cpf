#ifndef QUEUE_LIBRARY_H
#define QUEUE_LIBRARY_H

/* QueueLibrary.h
 *
 * A layer of abstraction around whatever queue library we are
 * using at the moment.  We seem to have many queue libraries
 * that change frequently, so the need for this has become
 * a reality.
 *
 * This is intended to be as general as need be, but no more
 * so.  Its generality is expected to increase monotonically.
 *
 * These implement an AnalysisGroup.  Why?
 *
 *  - Because there are multiple implementations of
 *    the queue library, each with different capabilities
 *    and which require different support code.
 *
 *  - Because certain passes (MTCG) depend upon this
 *    functionality, yet we want to decouple it from
 *    the MTCG algorithm.
 *
 *  - Because as an analysis group, we can select
 *    a particular queue implementation from
 *    the commandline (e.g. -hanjun).
 *    We can decide at run time, and do not need to
 *    decide at compile time.
 *
 *  - Because every five minutes or so, the Liberty group
 *    invents a new variant of (or at least a new interface
 *    to) the queue.
