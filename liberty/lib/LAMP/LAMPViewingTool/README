*.out files generated by the LAMPLoadProfile pass should be found in
 the current directory when running LAMPDirectory or LAMPDirByLine.
The three outfiles are:
  lcout.out -- always required, contains most loop-carried dependences.
  dout.out -- not required, contains most non-lc true dependences.
  auxout.out -- not required, contains special case data for both lc
  	     and non-lc dependences.

LAMPDirectory forms a directory from all dependence data, searchable
by variable name for DEPENDS ON and REQUIRED BY relations.  Can
recursively generate these trees.  Max recursive depth set by command
line parameter:
     [outfile_directory]$ LAMPDirectory MAXDEPTH

LAMPDirByLine strips all variable name information in favor of
generating dependence information only by line number and function
name.  Otherwise operates in the same manner as LAMPDirectory.
     [outfile_directory]$ LAMPDirByLine MAXDEPTH
